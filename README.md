# API-Projects
Surfing through my Full-Stack Web-Development journey I came across API's(Application Programming Interface). API's basically give developers access to various functionalities and data, making it easy to integrate with preexisting services. I also learned using nodemon that helped in automatically restarting the server once the changes were made to the program. While building the attached project I used postman a lot which simplified each step of the API lifecycle and helped to build, test and modify APIs. In this project I've created API's for widely used operations such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for a hardcoded temporary database.
